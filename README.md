# CISCO-PROJECTS
HERE IN THIS FILE I CREATED A PROJECT ON SMOKE DETECTION USING IOT DEVICES. IT WILL BE USEFUL IN FIRE PREVENTION SYSTEM IN BUILDINGS AND WE CAN PUT THIS INTO ANY PERMISES. AFTER DETECTING THE SMOKE, THIS SYSTEM WILL REPORT TO THE HUB OF WATER SPRINKLERS. AS SOON AS WATER SPRINKLERS GET THE MESSAGE, THEY'LL START SPRINKLING THE WATER.
